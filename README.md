# My Karabiner config
Karabiner allows reconfiguration of keyboard key handling in MacOS. I found it looking for a solution to the meta key not working in [kitty][]. I suspect I will be able to consolidate all my other MacOS specific key rebindings here as well.
## Installation

Clone this repo to ~/.config/karabiner, then install karabiner with:

    brew cask install karabiner-elements

I haven't confirmed this yet, and there may be additional steps necessary in the UI.
